            <div class="pl-4">
                <p>Hello! I go by Nova! I'm a highly functioning autistic lady who has literally no social media due to disliking it more and more over time. Which means I have high anxiety, so please be patient with me but I am not considering any more socials unless further notice!</p>
     		<p>Yes, I've closed my Toyhou.se account by requesting closure for it. I've moved on from it, and please do not offer me back on anything in general because I get uncomfortable with that. I know it's weird that I think that, but I usually try to stick with my choices... but I always thank you for suggesting though! If I need help on thinking of a platform, then yeah, you may give me ideas.</p>
		<p>Another reason why I refuse going onto social media is because in the past, I've always deleted and switched accounts. I had username issues for years but until I came up with the username, "Novawko", I actually sticked with it since late 2021! I needed to leave socia media because I disliked it over the time being in general. It's also hard for me to manage a list of platforms, so I limit myself. I also made accounts for no reason just because of my username, so those are gone too. I had to go through 100+ passwords in my Bitwarden and saw so many unused accounts...</p>
		<p>Anyway, let's talk about my interests! I love cats as you may notice with my art. Cats are my favorite animal since I was a toddler. Hamsters are my second-favorite. My favorite color is light/baby pink because I currently still own my baby blanket from my childhood that was that color... but it's decaying due to age but it helps me sleep at night as my permanent comfort item. Fandoms that I enjoy are: Warrior Cats, FNAF, Animal Jam, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Pokémon! My favorite Pokémon is Eevee and its evolutions. My favorite FNAF animatronic is Springtrap! I love NCS music, heavy metal, alternative and rock music.</p>
		<p>Man... I've been with Kebino since June 10th, 2021! I'm happily in love with him and he has helped me with my depression over the years. It took a while for me to realize his love towards me because of my tramua with relationships in the past... because of the tramua, I will be creeped and annoyed by specific phrases even though you're a totally different person.</p>
		<p>Fun fact! I've been in Japan once with Kebino in October 2023... going to visit again in Novemeber 2024 with him!</p>
		<p>Well, I think I spoke enough for now... Feel free to go to the FAQ for more stuff about me!</p>
